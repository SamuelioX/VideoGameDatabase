# VideoGameDatabase

VideoGameDatabase (https://www.vglist.net) was written as a capstone project in AngularJS and Node.js with a focus on learning how to implement REST APIs and consume them in a webpage format. This is the front-end portion of the website, with the back-end of the website 
here: (http://github.com/SamuelioX/VideoGameDbServer). 

This website is a hub for keeping track of the amount of video games that you have completed, interested in, or never heard of. Users can create an account and start going through a list of video games to track their progress (currently supports SNES games only).
